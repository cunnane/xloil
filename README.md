xlOil
=====

xlOil provides framework for interacting with Excel in different programming
languages. It gives a way to write functions in a language and have them 
appear in Excel as worksheet functions or macros or have them control GUI elements. 
For example, the Python bindings can replace VBA in almost all use cases 
and even provide functionality not available from VBA.

xlOil is designed to have very low overheads when calling your worksheet 
functions.

xlOil supports different languages via plugins. The languages currently 
supported are:

- C++
- Python
- SQL

In addition there is *xlOil_Utils* which contains some handy tools which Microsoft
never quite got around to adding.

The latest stable documentation is here: https://xloil.readthedocs.io/en/stable.

Supporting other languages
--------------------------

You can use xlOil as an end-user of these plugins or you can use it to write
you own language bindings (and ideally add them to the repo).
