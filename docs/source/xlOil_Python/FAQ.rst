ImportError: Typelib different than module
------------------------------------------

When using `comtypes` for COM support, then auto-generated modules can go out of sync, for example, if
you upgrade `comtypes`.  Fix this at a command prompt with 

.. highlight:: dosbatch

:: 

    C:\ > where clear_comtypes_cache.py
    C:\MyPythonDist\Scripts\clear_comtypes_cache.py
    C:\ > python C:\MyPythonDist\Scripts\clear_comtypes_cache.py -y

You'll probably need to restart Excel.


Intellisense / Function Context Help
------------------------------------

To activate pop-up function help, follow the instructions here: :any:`concepts-intellisense`.


Auto-reload doesn't reload a module
-----------------------------------

xlOil only watches for changes in modules which contain :any:`xloil.func` regisrations: it does
not do a deep scan / reload of all dependent modules as this could include large portions of your
python distribution!

Dynamically Resized Arrays
--------------------------

This is available in Office 365.  It would be possible to replicate this behaviour in older Excel 
versions however it is somewhat tricky, as the output ranges are not 'protected' as they are with 
array formulae or with the Office 365 support.  The code would need to:
 
    1. Hook the *AfterCalculate* event.
    2. Remember which functions output arrays in the current calc cycle and their calling cell.
    3. Remember which functions output arrays in the previous calc cycle and their calling cell.
    4. On *AfterCalculate*, loop through the functions in (2) writing their array to the worksheet.
    5. When writing the array, take care to clear any previous result from (3) but not to overwrite
       any other non-empty cells.
    6. Clear the ranges for functions in (3) but not in (2).
    7. Carefully handle the case where the output range for a function in (3) has been edited, for example
       it may now contain a function in (2)!

Unlike the built-in support in Office 365, the written arrays would be static data so, for example,
function dependency tracing would not work on them (except the top left entry).


This application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt platform plugin "windows"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under Anaconda (and possibly other distributions), Qt is installed outside the usual site-packages 
location.  A *qt.conf* file in the root dir directs Qt to the correct place. However under Windows, 
Qt will only look for this file in the directory returned by GetModuleFileName or in :/qt/etc/ which 
is unlikely to exist or be easily creatable on Windows.  (See https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qt-conf.html)
In our case GetModuleFileName always returns Excel.exe.

xlOil attempts to work around this by passing the correct location to Qt on start up, however for 
non-standard locations like virtual environments it may be necessary to set the 
`QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH` environment variable explicitly in xlOil.ini.  If `QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH`
is set, xlOil will not try to workaround this issue, so verify the value of this variable in the
lauching environment.


win32com / pythoncom: <some CLSID> has no attribute 'CLSIDToClassMap' 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The cache used by *win32com* has somehow gone wrong. Deleting the cache dir will cause a rebuild
which usually resolves the issue.  The location of this directory can be discovered with

::

    python -c "import win32com; print(win32com.__gen_path__)"

Either delete the entire *gen_py* directory or just the subdirectory corresponding to the CLSID
which is indicated in the error.
