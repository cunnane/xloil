xlOil
=====

xlOil is a framework for linking programming languages with Excel language. 
That is, a way to write functions in a language of your choice and have them
appear in Excel as worksheet functions and macros, as well as manipulating
the application and GUI similar to VBA.

xlOil is designed to have very low overheads when calling your own worksheet 
functions.

xlOil supports different languages via plugins. The languages currently 
supported are:

- C++
- Python
- SQL

In addition there is :any:`xlOil_Utils` which contains some handy tools which Microsoft
never quite got around to adding.

You can use xlOil as an end-user of these plugins or you can use it to write
you own language bindings and contribute.

xlOil features
--------------

* Python
    - Very concise syntax to declare an Excel function
    - Optional type checking of function parameters
    - Supports keyword arguments
    - Choice of globally declared functions or code modules limited to a single workbook (just
      like VBA workbook-level functions)
    - Tight integration with numpy - very low overheads for array functions
    - Understands python tuples, lists, dictionarys and pandas dataframes
    - Async functions
    - RTD functions and on-the-fly RTD server creation
    - Macro type functions which write to ranges on the sheet
    - Access to the Excel Application object 
    - Hook Excel events
    - Pass any python object back to Excel and then back into any python function
    - Simple and quick add-in deployment
    - Two-way connection to Jupyter notebooks: run worksheet functions in Jupyter and query variables
      in the jupyter kernel
    - On-the-fly creation/destruction of COM addin objects and Ribbon UI

* C++
    - Safe and convenient wrappers around most things in the C-API
    - Concise syntax to declare Excel functions: registration is automatic
    - Deal with Excel variants, Ranges, Arrays and strings in a natural C++ fashion
    - Object cache allows returning opaque objects to Excel and passing them back to other functions
    - Async functions
    - RTD functions and on-the-fly RTD server creation
    - On-the-fly creation/destruction of COM addin objects and Ribbon UI

* SQL
    - Create tables from Excel ranges and arrays
    - Query and join them with the full sqlite3 SQL syntax

* Utils: very fast functions to
    - Sort on multiple columns
    - Split and join strings
    - Make arrays from blocks

Why xlOil was created
---------------------

Programming with Excel has no ideal solution. You have a choice of APIs:

- VBA - great integration with Excel, but clunky syntax compared with
  other languages, few common libraries, limited IDE, testing and source 
  control very difficult, single-threaded, use not encouraged by MS.
- C-API - It's C and hence unsafe. The API is also old, has some quirks 
  and is missing many features of the other APIs. But it's the fastest
  interface.
- COM - More fully-featured but slower and strangely missing some features
  of the C-API.  It's C++ so still pretty unsafe. Has some unexpected behaviour
  and may fail to respond.  Requires COM binding support in your language 
  or the syntax is essentially unusuable.
- .Net API - actually sits on top of COM, the best modern interface
  but only for .Net languages and speed-limited by COM overheads, still missing 
  some C-API features.
- Javascript API - supports Office on multiple devices and operating system, but 
  very slow with limited functionality compared to other APIs.

xlOil tries to give you the C and COM APIs blended in a more friendly 
fashion and adds:

- Solution to the "how to register a worksheet function without a static DLL entry point" problem
- Object caching
- A framework for converting excel variant types to another language and back
- A convenient way of creating worksheet-scope functions
- A loader stub
- Goodwill to all men


Comparison between xlOil and other Excel Addin solutions
--------------------------------------------------------

Given the age of Excel, there are many other solutions for Excel add-in
development.

Most available packages are commercial (and quite expensive) so I 
cannot test relative performance with xlOil. They are generally
focussed on a single language rather than providing a framework
for language bindings as xlOil does.

The following, likely incomplete, list includes some of the most  
prominent Excel addin software. 

- Addin express: (commercial) fully-featured with nice GUI and the support
  seems good as well. Limited to .Net languages, but covers the entire Office
  suite (not just Excel)
- ExcelDNA: (free) mature, well-regarded and widely used, covers 
  almost all Excel API features, but only for .Net languages.  I strongly
  recommend this software if you are using .Net languages.
- XLL Plus: (commercial) seems to be fully-featured with GUI wizards
  to help developers, but only for C++ and the most expensive sofware 
  here.
- PyXLL: (commercial) Python-only.  Supports the full range of Excel
  API features and some functionality to run on remote servers.
- XlWings: (mostly free) Python-only. More mature sofware, but considerably
  slower (2000x in my test case) than xlOil due to use of slower APIs.
  Can only create 'local' functions backed by VBA, so every Excel sheet needs
  to be be a macro sheet with special VBA redirects. This means it is not viable
  for addin deployment.  Supports Mac and Python 2.7 (but licence fee required 
  for this).
